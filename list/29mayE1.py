Mountain Hiking Elevation Analysis

Problem Statement

A trekking company records the elevation (in meters) reached by a hiker at different checkpoints during a mountain climb.

A checkpoint is considered a peak checkpoint if its elevation is not smaller than its adjacent checkpoints.

Given an array elevation[] of size N, find the index of any one peak checkpoint.

Test Case 1

Input:
elevation = [1200, 1450, 1700, 1600, 1500]

Output:
2

Explanation:
1700 is greater than both adjacent values 1450 and 1600.

Test Case 2

Input:
elevation = [800, 900, 950, 1000]

Output:
3

Explanation:
Last element can also be a peak because it has no right neighbor.

Test Case 3

Input:
elevation = [3000]

Output:
0

Explanation:
Single element is always a peak.
