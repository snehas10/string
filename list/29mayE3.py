Industrial Sensor Peak Energy Monitoring System

Problem Statement

A factory machine records energy consumption at regular intervals.

A peak is defined as a value greater than or equal to its neighbors.

Tasks:

Find all peak energy values
Compute sum of squares of peak values
Compute average of peak values
Return difference between max peak and min peak
If no peaks, return -1

Test Case 1

Input:
energy = [20, 40, 30, 60, 50]

Output:
Peaks = [40, 60]
Sum of squares = 5200
Average = 50
Difference = 20

Test Case 2

Input:
energy = [10, 20, 15, 25, 20, 30]

Output:
Peaks = [20, 25, 30]
Sum of squares = 1525
Average = 25
Difference = 10

Test Case 3

Input:
energy = [5]

Output:
Peaks = [5]
Sum of squares = 25
Average = 5
Difference = 0"""
